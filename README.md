# Quantum Runner

## Disclaimer

**Disclaimer:** **Quantum Runner is a fictional video game that creatively represents quantum physics and tunneling phenomena for gameplay purposes. Regarding tunneling, we focus on the aspect that hitting a barrier generates a tunneling through component and a bouncing back component, but do not model the amplitudes for the components. This creative representation is used solely for gameplay and entertainment purposes and does not aim to provide an accurate representation of real-world quantum physics.**


This game was created during [Quantum Game Jam 23](https://itch.io/jam/quantum-game-jam-2023).

Quantum Runner is an endless runner game that combines the notable platform game subgenre with the challenge of managing multiple characters in a unique way.

Quantum Runner is about balancing survival and prosperity in a quantum setting.

**Survival:** In this world, there are obstacles that could potentially be fatal for the runners. To increase your chances of survival, it's helpful to employ quantum coherence to create as many copies of runners as possible. This way, even if some copies are lost, others will continue to thrive.

**Prosperity:** There are coins to be collected. In the event of a quantum collapse, only one runner and its coins will remain, while all other runners and their fortunes will be lost. Therefore, it's useful not to create an excessive number of copies, allowing you to maintain focus on the runners whose total fortunes are worth more.

**Quantum Runner** is based on the concept of quantum tunneling and offers a distinctive gameplay experience in which the player starts with a single runner in a never-ending level. As the runner encounters hurdles sideways, it splits into multiple runners, each of which takes a different path.

**Tunneling Outcome:** Your particle tunnels through splits and reappears on the other side.

Your goal is to collect as many coins as possible. The more runners you have, the more coins you can collect, and the harder it is for them to avoid obstacles.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Tunneling:** The game enables players to enter a quantum superposition state through quantum tunneling. Each time the character encounters a tunneling barrier, it creates a new copy of itself on the other side of the barrier. The original character and its copies exist in a coherent superposition until a quantum collapse occurs.

- **Multiple Runners:** After 3 splits, you should have 4 runners (or fewer depending on the choices made by the player during the game). The more runners you have, the more coins you can collect, and the harder it is to manage the runners.

- **Collapse Sites:** Collapse Sites are special locations that disrupt the quantum superpositions. When a single runner reaches this site, all other runners vanish, taking with them the coins and resources they've gathered. Keep an eye out for Collapse Sites and aim to send your most prosperous runner to maximize your gains!

- **Runner Elimination:** Runners face two critical conditions that can lead to their elimination. The first is collision with the cylindrical red barriers that populate the game world. Colliding with these obstacles can be fatal, so keen spatial awareness and precise timing are essential for survival. The second condition for elimination is not reaching the Collapse Site first when it appears. In this quantum adventure, only the leading runner and their collected coins and resources are spared when the Collapse Site activates.

- **Control Method:** All runners are controlled using a single left and a single right key, keeping the gameplay easily accessible.


## Gameplay Strategy

- The goal is to collect as many coins as possible and make them count. Remember, a collapse destroys all runners except one, and only the coins belonging to that particular runner are saved. Therefore, try to hit collapse sites with rich runners frequently to avoid losses.

- Manage your runners efficiently to gather resources and coins; do not let them fall off the Tunneling Bounce Universe or collide with obstacles!

- Make the right decision when encountering quantum barriers and electric fields.

- Use keys to change lanes and navigate safely in the Quantum Runner's Universe.

- Monitor collapse sites and aim to control the runner with the most resources to reach them first.
