# Tunnel Bounce

This game was created during [Quantum Game Jam 23](https://itch.io/jam/quantum-game-jam-2023).

Tunnel Bounce is an endless runner game that combines the notable platform game subgenre with the challenge of managing multiple characters in a unique way.

Tunnel Bounce is about balancing survival and prosperity in a quantum setting.

Survival: In this world, there are obstacles that could potentially be fatal for the runners. To increase your chances of survival, it's helpful to employ quantum coherence to create as many copies of runners as possible. This way, even if some copies are lost, others will continue to thrive.

Prosperity: There are coins to be collected. In the event of a quantum collapse, only one runner and its coins will remain, while all other runners and their fortunes will be lost. Therefore, it's useful not to create an excessive number of copies, allowing you to maintain focus on the runners whose total fortunes is worth more.

## Concept

Tunne bounce is based on the concept of quantum tunnelling and it offer a distinctive gameplay experience in which the player starts with a single runner in a neverending level. As the runner encounters hurdles sideways, it  splits into multiple runners each of which takes a different path.

**Tunneling Outcome:** Your particle tunnels through splits and reappear on the other side.

Your goal is to collect as many coin as possible, the more runners you have the more coins you can collect and the harser it is for them to avoid obstacles.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Tunneling**: In this game we tried to describe the behaviour of quantum tunnelling thorugh a barrier. When the character belongings encounter the barrier during the game some pieces may go thorugh some pieces might not. The player can choose to go back to gather the lost pieces using the resources collected on the other side of the barrier or continue running.
  
- **Multiple Runners**: After 3 splits we should have 4 runnersyou (or fewer depending on the choices made by the player during the game). The more runners you have the more coins you can collect and the harder it is to manage the runners.
  
- **Resource Management**:  [what can we say here?]
  
- **Collapse Sites**: This is a special location in the Tunnel Bounce universe. When the runner gets there all the other runners are lost. Therefore the player should try to control the runner with the most resources and coins so that the runner reaches the collapsed site first.
  
- **Tunnel Bounce Universe**: The Tunnel Bounce world conceptually looks like a cylinder, where distinct lanes are regions. You can pick up keys to change lane.
  
- **Control Method**: All runners are controlled using a single left and a single right key, keeping the gameplay easily accessible.
